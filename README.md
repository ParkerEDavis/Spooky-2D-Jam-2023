Very Very rough! A 48 hour jam was not a good idea for a first real game attempt, especially as that was my first time coding half of it.

Excuses aside, I like what I finished in that time, even if it doesn't have much of a purpose.

Art was all drawn by me, with a mouse, (I've got an artist for my next project).
